# Write a for loop that willrint the numbers 12, 18, 24, 
# 30, 36

for n in range(6,18+1,3):
    print(n*2)

# Which for loops will print all even numbers from 0 to 18?

for n in range(19):
    if n % 2 == 0:
        print(n)

for n in range(10):
    print(n+n)

# Fill in the blanks so that the for loop will 
# print the first 10 cube numbers (x**3) in a 
# range that starts with x=1 and ends with x=10.

for x in range(1,10+1):
  print(x**3)

# Write a for loop with a three parameter range() function
# that prints the multiples of 7 between 0 and 100. Print
# one multiple per line and avoid printing any numbers that
# aren't multiples of 7. Remember that 0 is also a multiple
# of 7.

for x in range (0, 101, 7): 
    print(x)

# Fill in the blanks to print the numbers from 15 to 5, 
# counting down by fives.

number = 15 # Initialize the variable
while number > 0: # Complete the while loop condition
    print(number, end=" ")
    number -= 5 # Increment the variable

# Find and correct the error in the for loop below. 
# The loop should print every even number from 2 to 12.

for number in range(2, 12+1, 2):
    print(number)
